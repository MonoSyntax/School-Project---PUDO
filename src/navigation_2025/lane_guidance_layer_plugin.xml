      Lane Guidance Costmap Layer - Provides soft guidance based on lane detection.
      Marks detected lane boundaries with configurable medium costs to encourage
      lane-following behavior while still allowing path planning across lanes for
      turns and lane changes. Unlike obstacle layers, this treats lanes as
      preferential paths rather than impassable barriers.
